# Getting Started

Batua is a React-based embedded smart account solution secured by passkeys. It provides an easy way to integrate smart account functionality into your application with support for transaction sponsoring, batch transactions, and seamless theme integration.

## What is Batua?

Batua is an embedded smart account wallet that:

- Uses **passkeys** for secure authentication (no seed phrases needed)
- Supports **transaction sponsoring** through paymasters
- Enables **batch transactions** for better UX
- Integrates seamlessly with your app's theme via **shadcn**
- Works with popular libraries like **wagmi**, **viem**, **ethers**, **privy**, and **dynamic**
- Gives you **complete code ownership** - no external dependencies

## How it Works

1. **Passkey Authentication**: Users authenticate using their device's built-in biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, etc.)
2. **Smart Account Creation**: A smart account is created and controlled by the passkey
3. **EIP-6963 Compatibility**: Batua appears as a regular wallet in your dApp, compatible with all existing wallet connection libraries
4. **Transaction Sponsoring**: Optionally sponsor user transactions through Pimlico's paymaster service
5. **Batch Operations**: Send multiple transactions in a single batch for better efficiency

## Why Choose Batua?
