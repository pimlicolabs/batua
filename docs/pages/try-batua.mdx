## What You Can Test

### 1. Wallet Connection
- Connect using passkeys (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, etc.)
- No seed phrases or private keys needed
- Secure authentication using your device's built-in security

### 2. Single Transactions
- Mint test ERC-20 tokens
- See transaction status and hash
- Experience sponsored transactions (no gas fees)

### 3. Batch Transactions
- Send multiple token transfers in one transaction
- Approve and transfer tokens atomically
- Experience the efficiency of batched operations

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Balance updates every 5 seconds
- Transaction status monitoring
- Live feedback on all operations

## Demo Environment

The demo runs on **Sepolia testnet** with:
- **Test ERC-20 Token**: A custom token for testing transfers
- **Sponsored Transactions**: All transactions are sponsored (no gas fees)
- **Safe Environment**: No real funds at risk

## Getting Test Tokens

The demo includes a "Mint test erc20 tokens" button that will:
1. Create a transaction to mint 100 test tokens
2. Add them to your smart account balance
3. Enable you to test batch transfers

## Understanding the Code

The demo is built with the same code you'll use in your application:

```tsx
// Connect to Batua
const { connectors, connect } = useConnect()
const batuaConnector = connectors.find(c => c.name === "Batua")

// Send batch transactions
const { sendCalls } = useSendCalls()
sendCalls({
    calls: [
        // Multiple operations here
    ]
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Passkey Issues
- **Not supported**: Ensure your device supports passkeys
- **Registration failed**: Try using a different browser or device
- **Authentication failed**: Make sure biometrics are enabled

### Transaction Issues
- **Transaction pending**: Wait for confirmation (usually 10-30 seconds on Sepolia)
- **Transaction failed**: Check the console for error details
- **Balance not updating**: Wait for the next balance refresh (every 5 seconds)
